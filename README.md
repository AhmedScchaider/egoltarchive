# Egolt Archive
### Search in any content in any time!

Egolt Archive is a pack of Joomla! extensions which provides the ability to present the Joomla! contents and any other sources in different intervals of time that you need to archive and search. This ability is not embedded in the Joomla! core ,however it is very practical and necessary.

#### Everything can be listed, Everything can be searched!
The power of different sources(extensions) integration in Egolt Archive enables you to list and search everthing you want. Here are list of native extension's integration (besides you can extend your needed extension integration, if you are a programmer):

* Joomla! Content
* K2
* jDownloads
* Phoca Download
* VirtueMart
* EasyDiscuss

In addition, this is not a simple search and the users can use different parameters in their search: selection date, ordeing, category, authors, included text and ...

Also, the results have various elements too: title, manipulated text & image, published date, category, author, hits and even comment count(Jcomments integration).

#### Feel the power of calendar and date!
Here is the list of calendars which we natively support them (most used calendars in the world):

* Gregorian (International)
* Islamic Hijri (Arabic)
* Solar Hijri (Persian)
* Russian
* Turkish

Also the "Calendar Module" with beautiful interface and ajax technology could help you to show the contents as event! (with number of articles per each day)

In addition, by "Search Module" you could put the search ability where ever you want and transfer the users to your listing easily.

One the other features in "Egolt Archive" listings is that you could set the date periodic! Some of the users just want to know how new the news or the content is. By this option for example, the users see the "2 weeks ago" instead of "10 July 2013".

In addition, by "Search Module" you could put the search ability where ever you want and transfer the users to your listing easily.

Also by "Date Module" you could list all the years and months with number of contents on them and consequently refering them to the proper listing.

#### Control and change all the elements just by your mouse clicks
All the elements you see in the components and modules are under your control. We made all the parameters and elements changable by website administrator.

#### How you want to display the contents?
Text & Image, Title, Photo Gallery of Feed

You could display the listings in 4 different display type:

* **Text & Image** By this view, you can list your contents by their image, text and all other deatails.
* **Title Only** By this view, you can list your contents by their title and some deatails. No image and text exist in this view.
* **Photo Gallery** By this view, you can change the contents to a simple photo gallery!

#### The authors are important, Don't forget them!
